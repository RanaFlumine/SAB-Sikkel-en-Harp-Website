Our new bi-yearly campaigns are announced on September 15th! These campaigns run for half a year with a fixed group, where you'll create your own character and go on multiple adventures together.

Game Masters will offer different systems and settings—you’ll be able to choose your preferred campaign once they’re announced.

Keep an eye on our WhatsApp group, Discord server or socials for the sign-up announcements and more details!
